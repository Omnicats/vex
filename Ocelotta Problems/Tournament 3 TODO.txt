for vision: aim at flags is the big one
aim at balls and caps would be nice too
maybe in auto we could aim straight at a platform, in teleop too just for fun

for the button control loop:
pre-auton brings up the buttons
ordering is like reading with colors as pages, ordered by expected frequency of use

main question atm is how to manage whether we're in competition or not, and the two choices are manual or automatic
upside of automatic is that we can't forget, downside is that we have to wait to plug in the controller
upside of manual is that we can prep before plugging in, but i don't think we actually ever did that so auto it is

if we're doing automatic determination, competition logic is pretty easy, if in competition we wait for a button press to set up the event listeners
if not in competition, we want to have user control but be able to trigger autonomous runs whenever we want, so have each button trigger a 3 second or so wait and then run that autonomous

gui for auto selection:
set up the buttons and have them remain in place, only register presses that don't occur while an auto is running
have them run as a task and include a cancel button both on the remote and on the gui

make a button class that draws itself and checks for being pressed with an update function, and stores an onPress function
said onPress function either sets the autonomous callback to its stored function OR runs a new task with that function
